# boggle
Our project is an OCaml version of Facebook’s Word Blitz game, also known as Boggle, but with our own creative tweaks that will 
make the game different and more original. For those who are not familiar with Boggle, it is a word game in which players are 
presented a grid of characters and they are expected to form words given those sequence of characters. These words can be formed 
by looking at neighboring letters in either the horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions. 

# features
On top of the basic features of Boggle, we added
* a leaderboard
* a time sensitive score (the faster you enter words, the higher score you get)
* a display of all of the possible words that was missed
* the option to import custom die and boards
* hints to find more words
* highlighting of the word found on the board as either green, red, or white
